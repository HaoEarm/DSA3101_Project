How can it be when Trust Bank can instantly accepted my application for their saving account and credit card? Do they asking for an annual incoming of $1,000,000?

53,RA DA,"VERY DISAPPOINTED. What is the use of asking us to open a Maribank account (via Shopee's recommendation) when SHOPEE PAY CAN ONLY BE TOPPED UP FROM & LINKED TO ONLY THE MAJOR BANKS?? Funds can only be transferred to Maribank from Shopee Pay but not vice versa. I also linked Maribank account to Shopee but it does NOT even appear at all at Top Up or mode of payment for Shopee purchase. Morever, face recognition for transactions always FAILS four out of five times. Frustrating UX.",1,2023-08-07 17:07:58,Maribank
