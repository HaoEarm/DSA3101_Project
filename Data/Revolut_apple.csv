channa_e,I was subscribed to metal and I wanted to close this account. So I downgraded. Had to pay $39 penalty fee which is acceptable. But even after paying penalty. I had to wait since some transactions were pending. I waited for few days. Then I check I had to withdraw all my remaining balance. Finally I finished all the required criteria and proceeded to close account option. Upon clicking close account this app gives 3 pop ups asking to stay. I keep clicking “close account” on all 3 pop ups and it finally proceeded to enter pin. Upon entering pin app says something went wrong. So basically in short this app does not let you to close accounts even after paying penalty. I’m guessing because it’s not categorized as a bank it is not being governed by banking law in the country. Ideally bank would get fined for forcing a customer to keep an account.,1,2024-03-03 15:05:39,Revolut

jango_sg,"So by some magical stroke of luck, my account was upgraded to a ""Premium Plan"" which costs $10 a month for features I don't need or used.

Then magically, the account goes into negative because the $10 was charged.

So you'd frantically go and see what this plan is and remove it. You can't. You need to downgrade which costs $10.

And because the account is in negative, you count downgrade

So you proceed to close the account but you can't because you still have a plan.

We did exactly that, made 3 purchases of more than SGD$10 each time, but on my app, it still shows only step 1 done and when I seeked help on the app, it rejected my reward as they said that my dad did not complete the steps.For my mom, her name just straight up was not on my referral page even after completing all the steps. When I requested for help, the system rejected my request starting that they have already rewarded me the money which did not make sense as it was still during the campaign period. The only one that worked was for my girlfriend’s account so a 1/3 chance that the referral works.

sfxnglin,"Context: Based on Revolut’s T&C, they would take your next available currency wallet, and exchange it at a real time rate if your main wallet does not have sufficient amount.

TLDR; Transactions are not made at the point of reference. It will be accumulated and you will end up spending at least 10% more than you expect to.

For Revolut cards, bus merchants will accumulate all the transactions for a few days, then deduct it from the first time you make the transaction.

For example, at that point of time when you took a trip of only 90cents, you had $1 in your account. 

Hence, you decided to top up your account with another $50 for your next few trips. However, Revolut will take your initial amount ($1) as a point of reference, to deduce your subsequent trips, despite having $50 in your account already.",2,2023-11-09 06:14:31,Revolut

They entice users for a free trial which they say will not be charged unless the user opts in.

aezjnn,"25 Jun received reply from developer, may I know which Bank maintenance for over a week? If you sincere to help, you do this: Set up a Giro using Maybank savings account. Log in to Maybank online banking, check the Revolut Giro is tied to your bank account successfully. Okay now you delete it. Then you come back to Revolut APP, can you see the Maybank account still in APP? If you can still see, click Revoke, does it remove the bank account link? In summary: 16/6 Terminate Giro directly by calling Bank, not via Revoke ( think this caused the issue now) 25/6 Bank account still shows in Revolut APP 17/6-25/6 Had clicked Revoke in APP which is dumb as there is no more Giro to terminate as per bank’s record. —————————————————————— I had linked a bank account to Resolut. The Giro was set up successfully as I log on to my bank account online banking, I can see Resolut Giro. However, top up failed, there is an error message about exceeding limit. Followed up with Bank, Bank said did not see any limit restriction for Resolut Giro. Okay, normal next step is to unlink and link again, right? So I terminated the Giro at bank's end. Guess what? Resolut DID NOT CAPTURE the Giro termination. That bank account still shows in Resolut APP. I can click on it but it does NOT activate a top up. Yeah, right, Giro to Resolut already terminated at Bank's side. How about re-link? Nope, APP indicates that the bank account is currently linked to my Resolut acocunt. Reported this issue, agent closed ticket with a non-resolution update. Great !!! What little confidence it inspires to use Resolut given the incapacity to fix issue with inadmirable capability? And a strange update? Surely, the unlinked bank account is now a set of numbers residing as data in the system tied to my Resolut account. It is most helpful to shed light how challenging it is to take a look at that and attempt a delete backend? Currently, am using other similar services, no issue with unlinking bank account.

ytksg,Ordered both the Revolut card and <18 for my kids. The kids card arrived with 2 weeks but the main card has not been delivered after almost 2 months even after I re-order the card. That’s poor delivery. There’s no chat or email within the app to allow feedback and contact. That’s poor customer service. I’ll not recommend this card. YouTrip is probably a better choice. Will not be using the card after we finish the credit we transferred to the card. There’s better choice out there.,1,2023-01-16 04:16:22,Revolut

Maple0204,"The team refused to extend a referral reward despite extensive promotions by claiming that only ‘invited people’ have ‘special links’ where someone can earn a referral. If you used a normal referral link, you wouldn’t be entitled to the $50 unless the person who referred you to was purportedly an “invited person”. Right from the get go, Revolut treats someone who bothered to sign up like a third rate customer. What’s the point of posting this promotion publicly if you’re only going to extend it to ‘invited people’ unless you were out to hopefully mislead people into signing up without having to pay the referral? 

2 hours wait time with 2 agents that were quick to leave the conversation. The 3rd agent was more patient but didn’t attempt to solve the problem. Instead, they consistently deflected the problem and asked the person referee to reach out to them instead to clarify their referral status. That absolutely didn’t solve the problem at all and I wish they didn’t waste my time.

Revolut’s behaviour absolutely disgusts me and I wouldn’t trust my money with them. I advise other users to re-read the terms and conditions carefully over and over again in case Revolut misleads you the same way I and many others have been misled.",1,2021-05-24 17:26:54,Revolut

Users getting locked out, unable to use funds, verification failure, etc... 

What kind of organization takes your money and locks you out?

What kind of app takes your money then asks for more verification to use your own money?

I would strongly recommend using Youtrip for all your travel needs FX. It does it right and does it good. If YouTrip doesn’t cut it for you try Wirex. 

As Revolut grows its doesn’t seem to bother about its users. Let Revolut get their processes and start listening to its users then perhaps use their services. 

Remember YouTrip or Wirex or Kubia could be worth a shot.",1,2020-01-25 03:02:05,Revolut
Premium Metal,"Revolut has the worst customer service ever. Go to their Facebook and read all the negative comments there! Despite being a premium metal card customer, they put me on hold for 3 weeks and still counting. After conducting numerous SOF reviews, they still limit my account. Their CSO talked down to me, implying that I lied. Asked very detailed questions for my transactions, and proceeded to question my reasons. My fund is stuck inside, and I shall close my account when they decide to reply. With so many restrictions, they might as well just tell what kind of transactions that I can do!",1,2020-01-24 15:22:00,Revolut

kelvinkwek,No way you can go pass the photo documents verification if it’s not accepted. And you can’t communicate the issue within the App as identify has not been verified. It just didn’t state why selfie and IC not accepted.,1,2019-11-16 07:37:44,Revolut
