I called customer service & was told they can’t do anything as it’s up to the internal team & that NORMAL approval process can take 3 mins up to 5 working days!!! There seems to be inconsistencies coz my friends said their application was approved immediately within minutes even when they applied it on a public holiday at night. I’m really disappointed.

I spoke to a chat agent Zhi Ching who sent me a template reply (screenshot-ed it) that the reason why my application was rejected is confidential and to apply again in a few months.

Standalone4eva,"If you’re a first-time salaried employee and would wish to get a credit card from Trust, you will have no choice but to wait for (S$30,000/your monthly salary) months for your CPF contribution to “tell” the bank that you’ve cumulatively earned the qualifying sum in a year, before they can approve your credit card. There’s no case-by-case assessment available. This is quite a departure from a friendly and smart digital bank image that Trust is trying to portray, and this is ironically, particularly unfriendly to their target audience, young population who are more well-versed in and receptive of technology. Do something, perhaps?

Update: I’ve enquired again through the in app chat as instructed by the reply, the correspondent threw me the same reason, telling me I didn’t meet the requirements.

Not to mention, whoever is running this credit card is probably the most apathetic person on Earth. Literally makes you feel like you owe them. Late payment? Good luck. You got to plead your case. Asked for a waiver but you need to provide reason. Are we in school? The cs makes you feel like they are doing you a service and you should be grateful. ""On a one-time goodwill"" I quote them. There's nothing good about this card other than the zero foreign transaction fees. Be careful not to miss your repayment date and think before you set it cause you cannot change it. Very incredibly inflexible to say the least. The cs increases your blood pressure. Even telcos have better cs. Sign for the freebies, redeem those and run. Please get this right, customers do not owe you our business. Stop giving us your elitist attitude.

When I first applied for the card, I set a very low credit limit of $2.5k when my salary would qualify for a much higher limit, thinking that if I want to use it more, I could always ask for an increase in the credit limit later, just like how we do with other banks. It is a total disappointment to be given such a reply that it is not possible. I asked if their back office can’t process a simple credit limit increase request, then does this warrant a card cancellation and a re-application to get a higher credit limit; and the reply was that this is still subject to the bank’s review.

ikanselar,So far I am very impressed with your app and services. While using your app on iPhone 8 and X. Recently i changed to iPhone 14 plus. Strangely I could not log in anymore by Singpass. It kept showing a worker sign as if app is under maintenance. A call to customer service ask me reinstall the app which I promptly did. But no avail. 7 days later I try again. Same issue. I am sure there is a way for me to log into my account. Kindly advice,5,2022-12-30 11:03:00,Trust

Customer service can only speak to account holder. My mum is non tech savvy person, she doesn’t even remember the steps to log in Singpass. How does it even makes any sense for her to speak to customer service on technical issue of the app? 

I suggested letting my mum pick up the phone for verification and allow me to continue the conversation. But was rejected. 

In the first place how can you even allow log in issues with banking/credit card application. If there are late payment charges etc who’s gonna take responsible? I’m pretty sure Trust is not willing to take responsible as per seen in the other reviews where ppl faces problem with waiving late payment charges.

3) your digital platform has lack a couple of options for customer to choose from , I’veSearch for service for paperless statement Nowhere to be found which I feel that this is a service that you need to improve on .

4) payment methods: it is unclear how I can make the payment, DBS ibanking?/AXN machine ?

Imagine the other your card was lost and need immediate attention but no one is there to help you, do you still want to bank with them?
On 05Sept, I left a message in the chat group for help. After waiting for hours, someone answered saying I can cancel either on the Insurance’s official website or via email. I wrote an email and followed up twice in the last two days, but again, no one reply. Then I asked in the chat group on 06Sept on how to cancel on website since no one replies my email, and again, after waiting for hours, they told they also not sure and need a specialist to advise…However, till now there is still no so called “Specialist” to contact me…
