Mostly bad reviews and issues. I don’t need developer reply to my review here as I’m absolutely not going to touch this bank anymore. And biggest joke of all, you don’t even have the most basic banking feature to save payee details. What kind of app development staff and quality is that???",1,13/9/2023 15:30,GXS Bank
44,gejeoqwo,Already 1 year but basic functions like adding payee is not in the app. It’s so troublesome to transfer funds to different bank accounts! With your latest move to reduce interest to 2.68% has made me feels like maribank is better even with slightly lower interest rate because they knows what basic functions to include in the app,1,12/9/2023 5:10,GXS Bank
45,Zzzsosian,"Notice that the drop in interest rate of 0.8% in saving accounts. GXS just come out with a reason to say many consumers want a increase in interest rate in main accounts as most of their funds are there to get the 1.2x points for dash and grab spending. Hence they decrease the interest rate to 2.68% in saving account and increase to 2.38% in main account .

The thing is GXS can increase the main account interest and maintain the interest rate in saving account. They will attract more consumer in this case. However, they use this opportunity to decease the interest rate in saving account instead and use the consumer as an excuse for the decrease.

I am very disappointed in GXS and have close my account in GXS. There are other banks offering a higher interest rate such as OCBC and UOB for saving accounts. No point sticking to GXS.",1,9/9/2023 8:33,GXS Bank

I had to wait since some transactions were pending. I waited for few days. Then I check I had to withdraw all my remaining balance. Finally I finished all the required criteria and proceeded to close account option. Upon clicking close account this app gives 3 pop ups asking to stay. I keep clicking “close account” on all 3 pop ups and it finally proceeded to enter pin. Upon entering pin app says something went wrong. So basically in short this app does not let you to close accounts even after paying penalty.

TLDR; Transactions are not made at the point of reference. It will be accumulated and you will end up spending at least 10% more than you expect to.

For Revolut cards, bus merchants will accumulate all the transactions for a few days, then deduct it from the first time you make the transaction.

For example, at that point of time when you took a trip of only 90cents, you had $1 in your account. 

Hence, you decided to top up your account with another $50 for your next few trips. However, Revolut will take your initial amount ($1) as a point of reference, to deduce your subsequent trips, despite having $50 in your account already.",2,9/11/2023 6:14,Revolut

Then you come back to Revolut APP, can you see the Maybank account still in APP? If you can still see, click Revoke, does it remove the bank account link? In summary: 16/6 Terminate Giro directly by calling Bank, not via Revoke ( think this caused the issue now) 25/6 Bank account still shows in Revolut APP 17/6-25/6 Had clicked Revoke in APP which is dumb as there is no more Giro to terminate as per bank’s record. —————————————————————— I had linked a bank account to Resolut. The Giro was set up successfully as I log on to my bank account online banking, I can see Resolut Giro. However, top up failed, there is an error message about exceeding limit. Followed up with Bank, Bank said did not see any limit restriction for Resolut Giro. Okay, normal next step is to unlink and link again, right? So I terminated the Giro at bank's end. Guess what? Resolut DID NOT CAPTURE the Giro termination. That bank account still shows in Resolut APP. I can click on it but it does NOT activate a top up. Yeah, right, Giro to Resolut already terminated at Bank's side. How about re-link? Nope, APP indicates that the bank account is currently linked to my Resolut acocunt. Reported this issue, agent closed ticket with a non-resolution update. Great !!! What little confidence it inspires to use Resolut given the incapacity to fix issue with inadmirable capability? And a strange update? Surely, the unlinked bank account is now a set of numbers residing as data in the system tied to my Resolut account. It is most helpful to shed light how challenging it is to take a look at that and attempt a delete backend? Currently, am using other similar services, no issue with unlinking bank account.

468,Alexandriariana,"Revolut has kept me verifying and reverifying my ID time and again. They even verified then unverified me! The reverification has happened more than 20times and I have been redirected from one customer service officer to another more than 10times, always with lies and false assurances that the issue is being sorted out in the next few days. They have told me my ID is expired, when the NRIC does not expire, and moreover, I have used MySingpass Info (our government platform) to verify my ID. I have used this same ID to open new trading and bank accounts since then on other platforms without any issue at all. I have also transacted official business over government platforms for my company using my same MySingpass ID to login. No issues whatsoever. I have taken pains explaining that my ID had my residential address updated (required by law) upon my getting my own apartment and that the date reflected is the date that this was updated. No where does it indicated the word “expiry date”. Do not trust revolut. They cannot even get their act together in such a simple matter as verifying my ID through the official MySingPass ID channel, how can they be trusted in more complex situations. Revolut has caused much trouble and upset, plus wasted time. It has been a most unprofessional and dubious platform, exposing me to risk through their suspect processes (by which I mean verifying and unverifying me repeatedly, having me share my full ID details time and again more than 20times. The irony is I am “allowed” to trade commodities and crypto, so apparently my ID verification is fine for that, but not for stocks. One word sums this circus up - RIDICULOUS!

If you used a normal referral link, you wouldn’t be entitled to the $50 unless the person who referred you to was purportedly an “invited person”. Right from the get go, Revolut treats someone who bothered to sign up like a third rate customer. What’s the point of posting this promotion publicly if you’re only going to extend it to ‘invited people’ unless you were out to hopefully mislead people into signing up without having to pay the referral? 

2 hours wait time with 2 agents that were quick to leave the conversation. The 3rd agent was more patient but didn’t attempt to solve the problem. Instead, they consistently deflected the problem and asked the person referee to reach out to them instead to clarify their referral status. That absolutely didn’t solve the problem at all and I wish they didn’t waste my time.

Revolut’s behaviour absolutely disgusts me and I wouldn’t trust my money with them. I advise other users to re-read the terms and conditions carefully over and over again in case Revolut misleads you the same way I and many others have been misled.",1,24/5/2021 17:26,Revolut

I’m based in Singapore and after days of trying I eventually found out that I can only add a small amount of funds to Revolut using Apple Pay and NO OTHER MEANS. Thus, I have EUR funds in my bank account and I want to use them when I travel to Europe...  and I can’t add those funds to revolut . 
So it’s useless!",2,30/3/2020 2:36,Revolut

Being able to use Apple Pay to top-up my card adds to the convenience of using the app, but I longed for full Apple Pay integration ever since the app launched in Singapore.

652,pancgom,"After reading all the reviews, doing a lot of research, Revolut looks like it is trying to do a lot of things with no focus to what it should do.

Users getting locked out, unable to use funds, verification failure, etc... 

What kind of organization takes your money and locks you out?

What kind of app takes your money then asks for more verification to use your own money?

I would strongly recommend using Youtrip for all your travel needs FX. It does it right and does it good. If YouTrip doesn’t cut it for you try Wirex. 

As Revolut grows its doesn’t seem to bother about its users. Let Revolut get their processes and start listening to its users then perhaps use their services. 

Remember YouTrip or Wirex or Kubia could be worth a shot.",1,25/1/2020 3:02,Revolut

Their CSO talked down to me, implying that I lied. Asked very detailed questions for my transactions, and proceeded to question my reasons.

Decided to check on their products, applied for a savings account and credit card.  Oops, they were quick enough to decline though I have banking relationship with multiple banks for years.

Now I understand why many users felt it is ‘Better to have a bank with a human being at the front desk, than on trying such virtual institutions’. 

Luckily, I did not have to suffer any deficiency in services, as my application to open a savings account and credit card was (instantly) rejected, really quick to process my application but not so professional to put me in dark.

I’ve no clue what the Fraud Team is investigating when I, the owner of the card, has already confirmed the transaction. And even if a investigation was needed, it’s been more than 12 hours and still no progress? For similar issues with other banks, usually the customer service officer would be able to help and have the card unlocked within 30mins.

1624,Avery Artemis,"If you think this is a good app for international payment, you are a deluded. Making international payment with ‘Revolut’ takes me only 10 seconds. Linking my local bank account takes only a minute or two.

I used this only because my Japanese client wants to be paid without bank deduction from his side. I realise WISE is so greedy that they charge you for everything including topping up funds even if it’s a bank transfer (They don’t allow you to insert the last allowed deduction date!). There was so many basic problems on the app. The information that want from us is highly privacy invasive (proof of address?). When making different currency payment, they do not tell us how much in local currency we need to top up to pay our client.

Now I have to figure out how to transfer out my funds. Worst trap ever. Lots of glitches in the app. The one I cannot accept is how it says I don’t have enough fund to transfer when my local currency is much higher than the foreign currency to be sent.

Idiocracy is its core design, extremely frustrating to use and is a huge time waster. And obviously costly to the clueless bunch of its current users— Speaking from a person in tech and a world traveller!",1,28/2/2024 8:34,Wise

It works most of the time, but when situations arise where you need to reach out or call customer support, I will say from my experience that the customer support is lacking terribly. We have deposits over SGD 3,000 that were stuck (unable to be withdrawn or used) for more than a month and to date, customer service has never got back or resolved the issue despite promising to escalate the case. Worse, their support line for business users in Singapore are inaccessible during local office hours and requires you to dial a foreign UK number. If you prioritise customer support and want safety of your money, find a real local bank with a branch that you can visit like UOB (I discovered that their Mighty FX has similar or better foreign exchange rates than Wise anyway) because if you need urgent help, you can always call and walk in to the branch.

It's even better now as it has virtual cards which makes so much sense if you lose your physical card or had to cancel for whatever reason. It is a different credit card though even if you find it through the same account. So I try to use virtual cards for internet shopping and apple pay. physical for places that don't offer apple pay.

However, recently I had accidentally transferred incorrect amounts. I submitted another transfer in the hopes that it would be topped up once received in the system (just through my bank app, not through the wise app). But the money was not detected by Wise due to the incorrect amounts (which I think is fair). 

I then submitted a request regarding a refund, however, Wise told me they did not receive the money, and requested I submitted the relevant documents as proof I made the transfer. I uploaded my documents and emailed promptly after the upload that I had submitted my documents - but I did not receive a reply or any indication that my refund request had been approved (as it is the weekend, so I expected it would take longer for them to reply). 

So when I made another (new and separate) transfer, I received a notification that Wise already received the money while I was in my bank app making the transfer. 

Thinking it was a glitch, I sent the money as normal, as it didn’t dawn on me that it could have deducted from the refunded amount I had requested. So now I have to submit another refund request as I was not aware that my refund request had been approved, and the amount did not even show up in my SGD account. Instead it took a transfer to trigger the refund. I now have two separate payments to get refunds for, would I need to make two separate transactions just to trigger these refunds too?",3,30/10/2022 4:08,Wise

Their support is abysmal as I’ve asked why, and I can’t even login to my account to check on the remaining funds in my Wise account. They said they would transfer them back but how would I know exactly how much is remaining? At least give some notice to the user first! This is such blatantly terrible service and absolutely untrustworthy to treat customers like this!! I loved using Wise but this latest development has just left a sour taste in my mouth.

When I ask for someone can help me to check for my payment, doesn't provide me with the help, but keep spam those useless articles. 

Transferwise, isn't customer service should be provide help for urgent case, system error rather than sending articles on Goggle?

Here's my suggestion:
1. Please fill your customer service' brain with all the basic terms and facts, at least let them know how is the app working. Lack of knowledge is worst.

2. Don't over promise your customer, when you can't do it in 2minutes, provide solution.

Firstly, the app is intuitive to use - great interface design (as compared to Payoneer). Secondly, it saved me couple hundred bucks compared to using PayPal (wish I’d known of TW earlier!!!). Thirdly, the speed is super duper fast - for SGD dollar it’s done in minutes, even in the middle of the night. For USD it’s basically completed within 24hrs. Fourthly, the fees are transparent and pretty much NEGLIGENT if you compare with alternative options (think banks, Western Union, PayPal etc.) and last but not least, the FX rates are interbank rates, rates that you can’t get anywhere else as an individual consumer. And it’s never failed me - more reliable than some clients I can say. Lols~ have been recommending TW to family, friends and business associates cos it’s THAT GOOD.
