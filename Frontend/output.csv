channa_e,I was subscribed to metal and I wanted to close this account. So I downgraded. Had to pay $39 penalty fee which is acceptable. But even after paying penalty. I had to wait since some transactions were pending. I waited for few days. Then I check I had to withdraw all my remaining balance. Finally I finished all the required criteria and proceeded to close account option. Upon clicking close account this app gives 3 pop ups asking to stay. I keep clicking “close account” on all 3 pop ups and it finally proceeded to enter pin. Upon entering pin app says something went wrong. So basically in short this app does not let you to close accounts even after paying penalty. I’m guessing because it’s not categorized as a bank it is not being governed by banking law in the country. Ideally bank would get fined for forcing a customer to keep an account.,1,3/3/2024 15:05,Revolut,2,0.03678133,0.963218689,0

jango_sg,"So by some magical stroke of luck, my account was upgraded to a ""Premium Plan"" which costs $10 a month for features I don't need or used.

Then magically, the account goes into negative because the $10 was charged.

So you'd frantically go and see what this plan is and remove it. You can't. You need to downgrade which costs $10.

And because the account is in negative, you count downgrade

So you proceed to close the account but you can't because you still have a plan.

sfxnglin,"Context: Based on Revolut’s T&C, they would take your next available currency wallet, and exchange it at a real time rate if your main wallet does not have sufficient amount.

TLDR; Transactions are not made at the point of reference. It will be accumulated and you will end up spending at least 10% more than you expect to.

For Revolut cards, bus merchants will accumulate all the transactions for a few days, then deduct it from the first time you make the transaction.

For example, at that point of time when you took a trip of only 90cents, you had $1 in your account. 

Hence, you decided to top up your account with another $50 for your next few trips. However, Revolut will take your initial amount ($1) as a point of reference, to deduce your subsequent trips, despite having $50 in your account already.",2,9/11/2023 6:14,Revolut,16,0.585008681,0.414991349,1

Winson Yeap,"Despite their good marketing and “premium” looking app design, their tactics are close to scam and is intended to TRAP users from the get go.

They entice users for a free trial which they say will not be charged unless the user opts in.

aezjnn,"25 Jun received reply from developer, may I know which Bank maintenance for over a week? If you sincere to help, you do this: Set up a Giro using Maybank savings account. Log in to Maybank online banking, check the Revolut Giro is tied to your bank account successfully. Okay now you delete it. Then you come back to Revolut APP, can you see the Maybank account still in APP? If you can still see, click Revoke, does it remove the bank account link? In summary: 16/6 Terminate Giro directly by calling Bank, not via Revoke ( think this caused the issue now) 25/6 Bank account still shows in Revolut APP 17/6-25/6 Had clicked Revoke in APP which is dumb as there is no more Giro to terminate as per bank’s record. —————————————————————— I had linked a bank account to Resolut. The Giro was set up successfully as I log on to my bank account online banking, I can see Resolut Giro. However, top up failed, there is an error message about exceeding limit. Followed up with Bank, Bank said did not see any limit restriction for Resolut Giro. Okay, normal next step is to unlink and link again, right? So I terminated the Giro at bank's end. Guess what? Resolut DID NOT CAPTURE the Giro termination. That bank account still shows in Resolut APP. I can click on it but it does NOT activate a top up. Yeah, right, Giro to Resolut already terminated at Bank's side. How about re-link? Nope, APP indicates that the bank account is currently linked to my Resolut acocunt. Reported this issue, agent closed ticket with a non-resolution update. Great !!! What little confidence it inspires to use Resolut given the incapacity to fix issue with inadmirable capability? And a strange update? Surely, the unlinked bank account is now a set of numbers residing as data in the system tied to my Resolut account. It is most helpful to shed light how challenging it is to take a look at that and attempt a delete backend? Currently, am using other similar services, no issue with unlinking bank account.

Hence, I dm-ed the team on their Instagram & they replied that the team would escalate the case to get it done for me.

It has been 2 weeks since I raised my concerns, yet I wasn’t getting updates from them, not to mention the issue of being stuck on the verification page unresolved. 

Absolutely inefficient, frustrating experience as a consumer. Please do not download this app! I have $20 deposited that is stuck there forever.",1,1/5/2023 14:24,Revolut,60,0.012572401,0.987427533,0
Alexandriariana,"Revolut has kept me verifying and reverifying my ID time and again. They even verified then unverified me! The reverification has happened more than 20times and I have been redirected from one customer service officer to another more than 10times, always with lies and false assurances that the issue is being sorted out in the next few days. They have told me my ID is expired, when the NRIC does not expire, and moreover, I have used MySingpass Info (our government platform) to verify my ID. I have used this same ID to open new trading and bank accounts since then on other platforms without any issue at all. I have also transacted official business over government platforms for my company using my same MySingpass ID to login. No issues whatsoever. I have taken pains explaining that my ID had my residential address updated (required by law) upon my getting my own apartment and that the date reflected is the date that this was updated. No where does it indicated the word “expiry date”. Do not trust revolut. They cannot even get their act together in such a simple matter as verifying my ID through the official MySingPass ID channel, how can they be trusted in more complex situations. Revolut has caused much trouble and upset, plus wasted time. It has been a most unprofessional and dubious platform, exposing me to risk through their suspect processes (by which I mean verifying and unverifying me repeatedly, having me share my full ID details time and again more than 20times. The irony is I am “allowed” to trade commodities and crypto, so apparently my ID verification is fine for that, but not for stocks. One word sums this circus up - RIDICULOUS!

Support team has minimal knowledge to resolve your issue, that is as good as they keep the case chat open so if you need someone to talk to, yeah they are there. This is also frustrating because they cant give you concrete answer.

If you used a normal referral link, you wouldn’t be entitled to the $50 unless the person who referred you to was purportedly an “invited person”. Right from the get go, Revolut treats someone who bothered to sign up like a third rate customer. What’s the point of posting this promotion publicly if you’re only going to extend it to ‘invited people’ unless you were out to hopefully mislead people into signing up without having to pay the referral? 

2 hours wait time with 2 agents that were quick to leave the conversation. The 3rd agent was more patient but didn’t attempt to solve the problem. Instead, they consistently deflected the problem and asked the person referee to reach out to them instead to clarify their referral status. That absolutely didn’t solve the problem at all and I wish they didn’t waste my time.

Ashley Sandusky,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE my Revolut account!! BY FAR, the coolest looking cards, & don't get me started on all the AWESOME SECURITY FEATURES! One of the most helpful, I think, is the Location-Based Securty feature! They will AUTOMATICALLY DECLINE ANY TRANSACTION ATTEMPTED WITH YOUR DEBIT CARD IF YOUR PHONE ISN'T @ THE SAME LOCATION WHERE THE TRANSACTION IS BEING ATTEMPED, & you can easily switch it off whenever. If you travel a lot then you NEED this account! Check it out you won't regret it TRUST ME!",5,25/3/2024 6:24,Revolut,382,0.994365215,0.005634766,1

Adam King,I am not a huge fan of this new update but getting used to it now. One huge issue I have with the trading platform is that the stock ticker does not keep pace with the stock movement. If a stock reads as $5 for instance the ticker might stay sitting at $4.90 for maybe five minutes before it catches up. This is absolutely ridiculous as it's showing conflicting information in a single view. This was not the case before the update and should not be happening.,3,22/3/2024 23:39,Revolut,631,0.066456631,0.933543324,0
